## Ken Mori's First CS193 Homework

This is the first official homework assignment for CS 19300!

CS 19300 is a great course and I am happy to be in it!
 

### Here are some of my favorite things about this course:

- **NO EXAMS!!!**
-  _Learning how to be professional with Github_
- `Free access for help from TAs`
