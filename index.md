## Ken Mori's First CS193 Homework

This is the first official homework assignment for CS 19300!

CS 19300 is a great course and I am happy to be in it!
 

### Here are some of my favorite things about this course:

1. **NO EXAMS!!!**
2. _Learning how to be professional with Github_
3. `Free access to help from TAs`
